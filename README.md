# purple

install pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml



purple is a game in which one player attempts to fill one of five lanes with their color. 

Players add color to a lane by clicking the box below the lane but only three switches can be on at once. 

Lanes only change if one player is pushing and the other player is not. 

If both players push or neither players push the lane will not move.
